SheepShaverPrefs

December 24, 2006 (Merry Christmas!) [ Updated to 1.0.1 on December 25, 2006 ]

This a preferences editor for SheepShaver 2.3 for Mac OS X. It may not work with other versions of SheepShaver. 

I wrote this program because the GTK+ "SheepShaverGUI" program that came with
SheepShaver offers an absolutely terrible experience on Mac OS X.

To use the it, simply place "SheepShaverPrefs" into the SheepShaver-2.3 folder
and launch it when you need to edit the preferences.

The code for the program is licensed under GPL, and is included.

Enjoy.
